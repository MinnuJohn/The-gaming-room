## Features

- Multi-user game application
- Four rounds of play with a one-minute duration each
- Rendering images from a library of stock drawings for guessing puzzles
- Basic Authentication for security (to be replaced with a more robust mechanism)

## Security

The application incorporates Basic Authentication as a temporary security measure. This will be replaced with a more robust authentication mechanism in the future.

## Multi-Platform Compatibility

The project includes a simulated environment prototype to demonstrate multiple platform options. Compatibility testing has been performed on [list of platforms].

## Evaluation of Platforms

A thorough evaluation of each platform's characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses has been conducted. Findings are detailed in the software design template.

## Multi-User Functionality

Draw It or Lose It supports multiple instances of the game running simultaneously, each with players and teams.

## Storage and Memory Management

Consideration has been given to how storage and memory are managed in each platform, with attention to differences in management.



### What Was Done Well in Developing Documentation:

1. **Thoroughness:** The documentation provides a comprehensive overview of client requirements, software features, and the planned development process.
2. **Security Considerations:** Addressing security concerns early on with Basic Authentication demonstrates a proactive approach to safeguarding the application.
3. **User-Centric Design:** The interpretation of user needs is emphasized, indicating a focus on creating a user-friendly experience.

### Process of Working Through a Design Document:

The process of working through a design document was helpful in understanding and planning for security features, multi-platform compatibility, and user needs. It served as a roadmap for development, ensuring that key aspects were considered and addressed systematically.

### One Part to Revise and How to Improve It:

If one part were to be revised, it might involve providing more details on the specifics of the multi-platform development strategy or a more detailed plan for the transition from Basic Authentication to a more robust security mechanism. Improvement could involve adding clearer milestones or steps in the transition process for better implementation.

### Interpreting User Needs and Importance:

Interpreting user needs involves understanding the emphasis on effective interfaces, security, and the multi-user nature of the game. Considering user needs is crucial for creating a successful and user-friendly application, as user satisfaction directly impacts the success and adoption of the application.

### Approach to Designing Software and Future Strategies:

The approach involves considering security, multi-platform compatibility, and user-centric features. Future strategies may include more in-depth analysis of platform characteristics and continuous improvement in security mechanisms beyond Basic Authentication. Techniques such as user feedback analysis, iterative design, and usability testing could be employed in future projects for enhanced user satisfaction and application success.
